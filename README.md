# BookMarker
### Bookmark websites using local storage 

Booklist used table for list in the UI, here we used ul. My considerations:
  1. There are two buttons
  2. No need for showing attributes(just the website name)

Ideas:
  - [x] Check for valid url.
  - [ ] Touch up UI.
  - [x] Editor: selecting multiple wibsites and apply action.
  - [ ] Website folder.

Note: localstorage empty object issue fixed by calling localStorage.clear. Cause of the bug unknown.
